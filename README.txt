Shrine in the Woods
Interactive Python Application

The well-being of the community is inseparable from that of the self. “Shrine in the Woods” tells the story of a supernatural guardian - played by the user - and the lives of its village constituents. They engage with each other through an exchange of questions, offerings, and wisdom. The user shapes the world through these interactions, and by their own hand can foster growth (or stillness) in the lives of others.
